# nuclear pSMAD quantification process

This folder contains Image J Macros for nuclear pSMAD quantification (https://github.com/yaeraw/Master_Thesis/blob/9c343efb3f33900cf990819fb2c15cc7c15bc6de/nuclear_pSMAD_quantification/1_save_z_project.ijm).

First the maxium z-projections of all three channels are saved.

Nuclear ROIs are created semi automatically using Huangs threshold. 

These nuclear ROIs are then overlaid on all three channels and the user can pick, which ones to measure.
