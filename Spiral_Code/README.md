# Spiral Code

Spiral deformation is quantified and visualized with the [here](https://github.com/yaeraw/Master_Thesis/blob/346310a4018af4c070a5b4b1c7715fe90e57b343/Spiral_Code/Spiral_deformation_analysis.ipynb) shown code. The input is a tiff stack of masks of the spiral only optained from ImageJ.

The spiral is subtracted from the microscope images for cell counting with Cellpose with the [here](https://github.com/yaeraw/Master_Thesis/blob/346310a4018af4c070a5b4b1c7715fe90e57b343/Spiral_Code/Spiral_Subtraction_Code.ipynb) shown code. Inputs are maximum z-stacks of the spiral with and without cells.
